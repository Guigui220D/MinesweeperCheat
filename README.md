# Minesweeper Cheat

This program uses the SFML

MinesweeperCheat is a program I made for fun to cheat on Windows Minesweeper
I used CheatEngine to find the addresses

The cursor has a colored square that indicates if theres a mine under the cursor
You can also press B to play the game automatically in no time

This is a very simple program, I know SFML is overkill just for that but it was a project for fun

You can contribute if you want

Note : If your windows display zoom is not 100%, it will not work!

### Controls
A : Detect the grid
B : Bot mode, play automatically
